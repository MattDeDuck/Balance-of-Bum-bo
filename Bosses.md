| Character  | Thoughts when tested |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| Brave      | Made the fight easier, however sometimes prone to damage |
| Nimble     | Sometimes quite tough due to Toothpick being doomed     |
| Stout      | Sometimes quite challenging due to Stick being doomed     |
| Weird      | Made the fight even easier than it is with him |
| Dead       | Still can 1 turn destroy due to starting items |
