# Balance-of-Bum-bo

Status: Unreleased

Putting together a compilation of balances the community have suggested and working on testing them out. 
---
## How I'm testing balances
I am testing out the balances by using Bum-Bo characters (Brave, Nimble, Stout, Weird, Dead) with nothing other than starter items, spells or trinkets to gain a fair test of the balance.

## Being Tested

### Tader
* Reducing the moves to 1 (from 2)

---
## To Look At

### Enemies
_**Tader**_
* Reducing moves to 1?

### Bosses

_**Tainted Peeper**_
* ???

---
## Tested

### Enemies

_**Meat Golem**_

* Health remains at 7, however no healing.

### Bosses

_**Pyre**_

* Now only spawns Wisps when extinguished and doesn't spawn Wisps when hurt


| Character  | Thoughts when tested |
| -----------|:-------------:|
| Brave      | Made the fight easier, however sometimes prone to damage |
| Nimble     | Sometimes quite tough due to Toothpick being doomed     |
| Stout      | Sometimes quite challenging due to Stick being doomed     |
| Weird      | Made the fight even easier than it is with him |
| Dead       | Still can 1 turn destroy due to starting items |
