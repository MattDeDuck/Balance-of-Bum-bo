# Balance-of-Bum-bo

Status: Unreleased

Putting together a compilation of balances the community have suggested and working on testing them out.

## How I'm testing balances
I am testing out the balances by using the base Bum-Bo characters with no extra items, spells or trinkets to gain a fair test of the balance.

## Being Tested
