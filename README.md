# Balance-of-Bum-bo

Status: Unreleased

Putting together a compilation of balances the community have suggested and working on testing them out. Feel free to suggest any balance changes you would like to see so I can test them out!

## How I'm testing balances

I am testing out the balances by using Bum-Bo characters (Brave, Nimble, Stout, Weird, Dead) with nothing other than starter items, spells or trinkets to gain a fair test of the balance.
