# Balance-of-Bum-bo

Status: Unreleased

Putting together a compilation of balances the community have suggested and working on testing them out. 
---
## How I'm testing balances
I am testing out the balances by using the base Bum-Bo characters with no extra items, spells or trinkets to gain a fair test of the balance.

## Being Tested

### Pyre
* Now only spawns Wisps when extinguished
* Doesn't spawn Wisps when hurt
---
## To Look At
### Meat Golem
* Reducing health to 5?

### Tader
* Reducing moves to 1?
